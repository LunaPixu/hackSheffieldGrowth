# Forestry Automata
A cute take on cellular automata but with trees! Plant seeds on a grassy grid and watch as they grow, spread seeds, and possibly die.

Forestry Automata takes place on a grid (default 10x10 but can be set to any size). Once you have your grid, simply click on any of the empty cells and click "Next Step".
* Clicking an empty cell will plant a seed that, over the next few steps, should grow into a tree.
* If they are mature or close to mature, you can click a tree to chop it down leaving an empty cell behind.
* Mature trees will naturally plant their own seeds. Mature trees also cast shade on adjacent trees - too much shade and these trees will either stop growing or die.
* Dead trees will completely remove adjacent living trees but subsequently revive as saplings.
